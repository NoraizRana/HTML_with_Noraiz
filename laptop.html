A laptop or laptop computer is a small, portable personal computer (PC) with a "clamshell" form factor, 
typically having a thin LCD or LED computer screen mounted on the inside of the upper lid of the clamshell 
and an alphanumeric keyboard on the inside of the lower lid. The clamshell is opened up to use the computer. 
Laptops are folded shut for transportation, and thus are suitable for mobile use.[1] Its name comes from lap, 
as it was deemed to be placed on a person's lap when being used.
